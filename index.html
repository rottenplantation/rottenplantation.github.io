                <p><a href="https://www.rahardhika.com">Rahardhika Utama</a> is a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at Northwestern University. As an Arryman Scholar from Indonesia, Rahardhika’s research focuses on the variation of development among agrarian economies in the Global South. He examines historical factors that transform and sustain agrarian society by tracing domestic and international forces from colonial to contemporary periods that affect paths of economic development. For his dissertation project, <em>Embedded Peasantry and Economic Transformation in the Asian Rubber Belt</em>, he employs the case of natural rubber plantation and manufacturing industries to examine the bifurcation of development among historically prominent rubber producing countries in Asia.<br/><br><a href="https://terminalbus.co">Perdana Roswaldy</a> is a sociology graduate student at Northwestern University. After four years of studying the Russian language and Soviet art politics, she took an unexpected detour to land conflicts and plantation economics in Southeast Asia. She received a Kellogg-DRRC grant for her thesis on land conflict and gendered climatic shock in 2019. Her current project is the afterlives of colonial plantations across postcolonial countries.<br/><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/cappimpong">Sofyan Ansori</a> is a graduate student at Northwestern&rsquo;s Anthropology. His research examines the governance of forest fires in Indonesia, particularly to the way environmental interventions are embraced, lived, and/or contested by both local people and state actors. Sofyan&rsquo;s solo-authored article recently published in the flagship journal of The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) <a href="https://bookshop.iseas.edu.sg/publication/2492">Contemporary Southeast Asia</a>, titled <em>The Politics of Forest Fires in Southeast Asia</em>.<br/><br><a href="https://twitter.com/arasimanjuntakk">Atmaezer Hariara Simanjuntak</a> is a graduate student in Anthropology at Northwestern University. Ara’s research tracks the legacies of colonial plantations in the Global South and how they emerge in the present both ideologically and materially. Combining ethnographic and archival research, he argues that deciphering the plantation logic remains critical to understand violent underdevelopment processes in postcolonial nation-states. This was made possible through the plantation’s ability to create and manage differently valued environments, bodies, and social relations, which, in turn, sustain capitalist accumulation. Ara is also interested in the political economy of financial systems, multispecies relations, and emerging forms of hope and morality among indigenous laborers in West Kalimantan, Indonesia.</p>

                <p><strong>Panel Abstract</strong><br/> Planter colonialism had waned since the Great Depression in the 1930s. However, some global south countries still hold a substantial plantation economy, preserved both by local and global political-economic interests. The persistence of plantations also has induced planetary social, political, and environmental transformation with its contentions, dispossession, and capital expansion. The lives of plantations have created self-sustaining friction where people, capital, and the state intertwined in tangled social interactions. Under this precedence and the legacy of colonialism, this panel discusses who roots for and who becomes rotten by the indomitable plantation system.</p>
                <p><strong>Politics of Memory, Underdevelopment, and Remnants of Political Violence in the Sumatra Rubber Belt</strong><br/>How does political violence perpetuate underdevelopment in post-conflict communities? This study complements literature on political violence&rsquo;s consequences on the economy by discussing the politics of memory as an important mechanism in preserving cultural and institutional legacies experienced by post-conflict communities. Evidence presented in this article also revises mainstream proposition on the origin of the anti-communist massacre in Indonesian history. Using archival research, ethnographic fieldwork, and oral history to study underdevelopment among rubber-producing smallholders in Sumatra (Indonesia), I find the official counter-memorial efforts have preserved the culture of fear, hampering rubber sector productivity in the area. In this manner, this article provides a mechanism that links political violence and the economy by assessing the politics of memory.</p>
                <p><strong>How many plantations does a state need? The Revitalization of Indonesia’s Plantations</strong><br/>This work investigates what revitalizing plantations do for Indonesia’s postcolonial transition and state-building. Indonesia’s relationship with plantation economics had always been contentious either as the legacy of colonialism or as the domain for global and domestic criticism for socio-economic and environmental calamities. The work presented here offers to see the path of postcolonial development in Indonesia through the lens of its plantation system. In doing so, plantation systems are considered as a foreboding institution crucial to postcolonial state-making, rather than a mere predatory development policy. Drawing from the archival sources, plantation-themed novels in the early 20th century Indonesia, and secondary literature of plantations in Indonesia, I argue that the dynamics of plantations in Indonesia reflect its visions for postcolonial modernity and socio-political imagination. Such plantations-dependent visions are gradually ingrained in the everyday political lives of Indonesia as a postcolonial state that tries to break from its colonial legacy and creates its own paths toward modernity and growth. They also translate into how the legal system, labor surveillance, and democratic experience folds into the plantation system, resulting in the atrociously durable outcomes commonly found in plantation-ridden states. Indonesian plantations then become a self-sustaining institution in which attempts to end them result in futile efforts, creating contentious politics even among the elites and workers.</p>
                <p><strong>Negotiating the burning future: Indigenous responses, plantation infrastructures, and fire governance in Indonesia</strong><br/>Responding to the massive forest fires in 2015, Joko Widodo—the current president of Indonesia—promised to solve such an environmental catastrophe by creating the Peat Restoration Agency (BRG). Supported by the government budget and international donors, this agency constructs extensive fire infrastructures to mediate and regulate future interactions between people and nature. While institutionalizing community-based fire control groups to maintain and operate canal blocks, canal backfills, and deep wells, BRG supervises plantation companies in managing their infrastructures. Before 2015, fire governance in Indonesia was equipped with nothing but bureaucratic procedures and oppressive apparatuses. Therefore, the salient feature of the new infrastructures is about the promises they offer to both the governing bodies and the governed subjects. Fire infrastructures enable previously absent action and participation in preventing and controlling fires. As nexus where tensions between BRG as planners and those who are expected as subjects are intensified, these new facilities become a terrain of negotiation. Findings from ethnographic experience in the dry season of 2019 show that these infrastructures have facilitated forest fires instead of preventing such a disaster. Such a paradox signals the disjuncture within the fire governance regarding how environmental notions lived by two different targeted subjects who share the intervened peatlands. While indigenous people did not engage with fire infrastructures the way the BRG expected, many oil palm and industrial forest plantations deliberately disregarded such infrastructures. By focusing on how intervention subjects perceive and contest fire infrastructures, this paper demonstrates that fire governance in Indonesia has been puzzled by indigenous responses and, more importantly, compromised by plantations’ negligence.</p>
                <p><strong>Stuck and Confused: Plantation Indebtedness and the Morality of Impoverishment</strong><br/>Much research has been done to uncover why microcredit does not alleviate rural populations out of poverty. However, a view from the plantation provides a more systematic and structural understanding of how poverty is produced and sustained.This paper asks why and how dispossession through finance persists in the plantation system? Drawing from fieldwork in West Kalimantan&rsquo;s plantation belt in 2016 and 2018 and secondary data from other researchers&rsquo; fieldnotes accumulated between 2010 and 2016, I argue that the plantation system&rsquo;s working and institutional arrangement sustains and perpetuates a regime of dispossession through finance.This was made possible by the colonization and folding of land laws and governance into the plantation system inseparable from International Financial Institutions&rsquo; (IFIs) effort to coerce the Indonesian state and plantation companies into debt. Along with this process, landless farmers&rsquo; effort to survive the plantation by taking credits from Credit Unions (CUs) leads them to moralize processes of systematic impoverishment, blaming themselves and their families for being poor. With their land and property stripped, farmers and their families become fixed in place, forced to be self-sufficient, and follow through the plantation system&rsquo;s illicit mode of governance.This violent condition of what farmers consider as being <em>stuck and confused</em> is why debt relations in the plantation differ from others and is the scale on which it should be further studied.</p>
